          <div className="paratext"style={{ color: '#000000' ,  textAlign: 'left', marginLeft:"4%",marginTop:30, width: "70%"}}>{"In the same year, a whirlwind of events unfolded, all centered around Motion Design. It proved to be an exhilarating period, marked by the official launch and remarkable success of my university's graphic design club. We not only cultivated a thriving community of graphic designers and enthusiasts but also exceeded our expectations by conducting engaging design workshops for students. Amidst these achievements, another pivotal moment unfolded at SOLE's office, where I formalized the graphic design club. Simultaneously, the university's Department for Student Affairs presented me with a valuable and lucratively rewarding student job opportunity. Joining SOLE's graphic design team opened the door to a plethora of projects, and I've since crafted numerous graphic and motion design visuals. Highlights include designing teaser videos for major university events featuring luminaries like L'ARTISTE, a North African superstar, and hosting concerts for prominent artists such as Tagne and 7ari."}</div>
